## About Me
Hello! I'm Giuseppe Genito, a master's student in **Data Science and Machine Learning**. I have a Bachelor's degree in **Statistics for Big Data** from the University of Salerno, Italy. I am passionate about exploring data, building machine learning models, and use IA for solve real word problem.

On this GitHub, you will find my projects related to:
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Data Visualization
- Robotics (with ROS)

I aim to contribute to the community by sharing my learning journey and providing helpful resources for others who are also passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects you can explore:

### 1. Spoken-Language-Recognition-without-Audio
A project carried out for the Computer Vision exam, I used a ConvLSTM2D to classify the spoken language in the video. The feature level fusion technique was used to improve the performance compared to students from previous years.

### 2. Development-of-a-Trading-Algorithm-using-Q-learning-to-Maximize-Profits
A project carried out for the Artificial Intelligence exam. I've develop an automated trading algorithm that utilizes Q-learning to make purchasing/selling decisions for financial assets

### 3. Emotion-Detection-Challenge-on-Twitter
Project developed for participation in the Hackathon dedicated to Milan Digital Week. It involves the use of the voting technique for sentiment analysis, specifically multiclass classification on texts from tweets

Feel free to browse through my repositories, explore the code, and use them for your own learning or projects!
